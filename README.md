This application is used as a test-case for the project OSCake 
which can be found here: https://github.com/telekom/ort 

It represents a simple "Hello World" program which includes license- and copyright statements 
on different folder levels and in source code files (hierarchical overlapping). It is only used 
for scanning the files and not to implement anything great. The dependency to "com.googlecode.json-simple"
is only defined to have another package to work with.
